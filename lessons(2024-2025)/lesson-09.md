# Lesson 9: Sculpt Like a Pro – Shape Like Digital Clay!

## Objective
By the end of this lesson, students will:
- Understand what Sculpt Mode is and how it’s different from normal modeling
- Learn how to use basic sculpting brushes
- Add detail to a simple object using digital clay
- Create a fun sculpted character or object (face, creature, or monster!)

## Materials Needed
- Blender Software
- Mouse (recommended — sculpting is harder with a trackpad)

---

## Introduction

So far, we’ve been building models using shapes like cubes, spheres, and cylinders. Today, we’re going to try something different and **way more artistic**.

🎨 **Sculpting in Blender is like using digital clay**.  
Instead of moving points one by one, we’ll *push*, *pull*, and *smooth* shapes just like a real sculptor!

This is how artists make:
- Characters
- Faces
- Creatures
- Monsters
- Rocks and terrain

Let’s dive in!

## What Is Sculpt Mode?

Blender has different **modes** for different jobs:
- **Object Mode** – move, rotate, scale objects
- **Edit Mode** – edit points, edges, and faces
- **Sculpt Mode** – push and shape like clay 👀

### Switching to Sculpt Mode

Switch to the **Sculpting** tab or choose **Sculpt Mode** instead of **Object Mode** in the top left corner of the screen.

Your object should now look a bit shiny, and a bunch of new tools will appear on the left.

## Preparing Our Object (Very Important!)

Sculpting works best when your object has **lots of detail**.

### Adding More Geometry (Subdivision)

1. Go back to **Edit Mode** and right-click your sphere → **Subdivide**
2. Or even better user the **Multiresolution** Modifier and click **Subdivide**
3. Repeat this **2–3 times**
4. Switch back to **Sculpt Mode**

💡 More geometry = smoother sculpting!

## Sculpting Brushes – The Main Tools

We will ignore the left side, and keep the **Brush** tool active, everything else is for advanced techniques such as masking.

On the bottom, you’ll see sculpting brushes. Here are the most important ones for today:

### 🖌 Draw Brushes
- Pushes clay **in or out**
- Hold <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> to invert the brush
- Great for making noses, bumps, muscles

### 🤏 Grab Brushes
- Pulls parts of the model around
- Perfect for stretching faces or moving features

### 🧼 Smooth Brushes
- Softens rough areas
- Hold <kbd>Shift</kbd> while sculpting to smooth

### 🔍 Inflate Brush
- Makes areas puff out
- Good for cheeks, blobs, or cartoon shapes

You can:
- Change brush size with <kbd>F</kbd>
- Change strength with <kbd>Shift</kbd> + <kbd>F</kbd>
- Turn on symmetry in the top

## Task 1: Make a Funny Face (Guided)

Let’s turn a sphere into a face!

1. Start with a **UV Sphere**
2. Use the **Multiresolution Modifier**
3. Turn on **Symmetry**
4. Use **Elastic Grab** to shape the head
5. Use **Grab** to pull out:
    - A nose
    - The chin
6. Use **Draw** or **Inflate** to make:
    - Cheeks
    - Eyebrows
7. Use **Smooth** to clean up messy areas

😄 Don’t worry about realism — silly faces are encouraged!

## Task 2: Create Your Own Sculpt (Creative Time)

Now it’s your turn to sculpt something original!

### Choose ONE:
- A monster
- An alien
- A cartoon head
- A creature
- A squishy blob character

Guidelines:
- Start simple
- Big shapes first, small details later
- Use **Grab** before adding tiny details
- Smooth often!

Instructor tips:
- Walk around and help students who “break” their model
- Remind them mistakes are easy to fix in sculpting
- Encourage exaggeration (big eyes, big noses!)

---

## Optional Bonus (If Time Allows)

- Switch to **Material Preview**
- Add a simple color using Materials
- Add two spheres for eyes in Object Mode
- Pose your sculpt using the Grab brush

---

## Wrap-Up Discussion (5 min)

Ask students:
- What brush did you like the most?
- Was sculpting easier or harder than normal modeling?
- What would you sculpt if you had more time?

Explain:
> Professional game and movie characters often start exactly like this!

---

## Homework (Optional)

- Finish your sculpt at home
- Try sculpting:
    - A different face
    - A monster head
    - A stylized animal
- Bonus challenge: sculpt **without smoothing** 😈
