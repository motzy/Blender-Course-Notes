## Instructor Intro (10-15 min)

1. Welcome students and explain today's session is a free build day.
2. Quick recap of skills learned so far:
   - Adding objects (<kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>A</kbd> > Mesh)
   - Transforming objects: Move (<kbd>G</kbd>), Rotate (<kbd>R</kbd>), Scale (<kbd>S</kbd>)
   - Adding and adjusting lights
   - Applying materials and colors
   - Basic keyframe animation
3. Show the project ideas below for inspiration.
4. Explain the session flow: decide what to build, then start creating. Ask for help anytime!

## Project Ideas for Inspiration

Not sure what to build? Here are some ideas to get you started:

1. **A Vehicle** - car, spaceship, boat, or airplane
2. **An Animal or Creature** - dog, cat, dragon, or make up your own!
3. **A Building or Room** - house, castle, bedroom, or secret hideout
4. **A Character or Robot** - superhero, alien, or friendly robot

Pick one of these or come up with your own idea!

## Free Build Session (the reaminder of the class)

- Students work independently on their chosen project
- Instructor circulates around the room to help anyone who gets stuck
- Encourage students to experiment and try new things
- Remind students to save their work regularly (<kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>S</kbd>)

Tips for instructors:
- If a student is stuck, help them break down their idea into simple shapes
- Encourage students who finish early to add lights, materials, or simple animation
- Celebrate creativity - there are no wrong answers!

## Homework
- Continue working on your project at home
- Try adding something new you haven't tried before (e.g., animation, a new material type, or more details)
